This program was written by Jonathon Galsurkar and Meredith Lancaster under the supervision of Prof. William Sakas
at Hunter College, Computer Science and the Graduate Center, Linguistics and Computer Science of the City University 
of New York. It is written in Python 2.7.12.

The program implements a learner that learns multiple abstract, human-like languages grounded in Chomsky's principles
and parameters framework. The learning model is one of first language acquisition, i.e., acquisition by a child of approximately
2 years of age. 

The learner and the abstract domain over which it operates is described in detail in:

Sakas, W.G. & Fodor, J.D. (2012) Disambiguating Syntactic Triggers, Language Acquisition (19) pp 83-143.
